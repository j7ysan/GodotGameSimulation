## Game Simulation/Animated Concept: 
	Basketball Mini-Game

## World Building:
	The world building that we have introduced in the minigame is essentially reminiscent of a basketball court,
	however of a more miniature size. The court features the sleek wooden floor with large towering walls that connect
	together with the camera angle to showcase the mountain of difference of the player (ball) and the destination object (hoop).
	With this it makes it feel more like a game and challenge, with them knowing the clear goal in sight.

## World Environment:
	The world environment features many aspects, one being the camera which is a dominant figure in determining how our gameplay
	will play out, the lighting, and much more. The camera is a dominant figure because it determines how and what the player views.
	In our case the camera is making it abundantly clear the objective is towards the (hoop), especially from the starting angle of the (ball).
	The lighting that we added helps to put these items into better light, we went with something not too obstructing, but that would add color to
	the game and world as a whole. The color is nearly parallel with the court, and it adds a sort of shine to the court as well from it, there is also 
	some ambient lighting features added in, which as the player moves around adds more depth to the world and world environment.

## Models and Items:
	The models and items featured in the game so far are:
		- Ball: The player-driven ball which is the focal point of the game, in our case, a basketball, modeled in Blender by Jasan.
		- Hoop: The destination or goal object for the player to reach, modeled in Blender by Jasan.
		- court-floor: The sleek wooden floor using a oak veneer texture from 'PolyHaven' (open) that gives a true basketball vibe.
		- court-wall: The wall, set from 'Albedo' standard colors, to add some basic elements to the game and make elements like the court-floor 'pop' out more.
